# Zee's Trims

This mod aims to implement some armor trims made by [SystemZee](https://www.youtube.com/@syszee), as well as his [Rainbow "Jeb" trims](https://youtu.be/MEwsfdl_zzk?t=1750&si=qBTxGidL4Jzsb392). No, I have not been given explicit permission to reuse a lot of his assets, but the experimental mod's license was MIT, which states that I may "modify and redistribute the software".

## Planned Features
- [x] "Jeb" armor trims (rainbow shader)
- [ ] Compatibility pack for Bare Bones
- [ ] Make compatible with Iris Shaders
- [ ] Add echo shard as trimmable material
- [ ] Add custom trims (frost, shaft, dive, villager)

## History

While browsing on youtube (totally not addicted), I stumbled across [this video](https://youtu.be/MEwsfdl_zzk?t=1750&si=qBTxGidL4Jzsb392) by SystemZee, and I immediately knew I NEEDED those smooth trims. So I tapped that "Join" button, and bought myself a developer's pass. However, the rainbow trims turned out to just replace quartz, so I decompressed the resource pack, and did a little modding. So yeah, that's basically it XD
