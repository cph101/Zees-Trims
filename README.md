# Zee's Trims

This mod aims to implement some armor trims made by [SystemZee](https://www.youtube.com/@syszee), as well as his [Rainbow "Jeb" trims](https://youtu.be/MEwsfdl_zzk?t=1750&si=qBTxGidL4Jzsb392). No, I have not been given explicit permission to reuse a lot of his assets, but the experimental mod's license was MIT, which states that I may "modify and redistribute the software".

## Planned Features
- [x] "Jeb" armor trims (rainbow shader)
- [ ] Compatibility pack for Bare Bones
- [ ] Make compatible with Iris Shaders
- [ ] Add echo shard as trimmable material
- [ ] Add custom trims (frost, shaft, dive, villager)

## FAQs

### Who gave you permission to make this?
I have not been given explicit permission to reuse a lot of his assets, but the experimental mod's license was MIT, which states that I may "modify and redistribute the software".

### Will you backport this mod to 1.x.x?
Unless I see an extremely high demand for a particular version, no - I see no point in creating mods for versions no one uses, and it requires a lot of effort to migrate the code between versions, and to maintain those for new mod releases.

### When are you going to update toÂ 1.x.x?
I will do when/if I have spare time.
